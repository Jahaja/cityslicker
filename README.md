## Cityslicker

A TCP server in C for searching geonames locations within a bounding box.
It will return the geoname-id of the cities within the requested bounding box.

*NOTE*: This is an educational project to familiarize myself with C and a few concepts within it. Use at your own risk.

#### Usage
1. Download/clone the files and navigate to the src directory.
2. make
3. Start the server using ./cs [geonames-csv-file].txt

For client, see the python example at client/cityslicker.py.
